## Project Charter: The Plant Sitter
### Motivation
Food security is an ever-present global challenge, growing increasingly entangled in other global challenges like climate change. This has been an ever-growing concern in The United States, particularly since the commercial introduction of fertilizer in the mid-1900s during The Green Revolution.[^1] This time period is when unsustainable processes like the over-use of fertilizers, pesticides, and monoculture practices began. As we begin to recognize the harmful effects of agricultural pollution, pesticide resilience, and the continual stripping of nutrients out of our soils, we have turned to technology to help turn the tides of sustainability in agriculture. 

Precision agriculture is an emerging field encapsulating a myriad of technologies aimed at collecting data on agricultural health in order to guide best practices.[^2] The goal is to use a variety of sensors to understand the health status and needs of an agricultrual unit, and then use emerging capabilities, like machine learning, to determine appropriate inputs. Such inputs would include resources like water, specific nutrients, or human intervention. 
	
Much of the technologies suitable to precison agriculture have parallels in human health monitoring, where the guiding principles are similar: sense, compute, adjust. It is for this reason the field of Organic Bioelectronics has begun to grow toward applications including both human and plant health monitoring. Organic bioelectronics are devices that are composed of organic, conducting polymer materials which can be fabricated at low costs. Their organic nature allows them to be tunable to fit a wide range of biocompatibility requiremetns for interfacing with living tissues. They also are ineherently better biological signal amplifiers than other organic electronics because of how the polymeric active materials interact with analytes volumetrically.[^3] 

Unlike human health monitoring where the cost of a device implant like a pace maker is high enough to justify sophisticated and costly electronics interfacing, organic bioelectronics can be fabricated for costs on the order of single dollars per sensor. With the hope that studying organic bioelectronics for use in precision agriculture will help guide further understanding of their interactions with living tissues in general, more affordable interfacing devices are required.

### Background
Organic bioelectronics consist of two major device families: electrochemical sensors and electrophoretic actuators. Both devices operate based on princples of ionic mass transfer which is transsduced into the electrical current that can be understood by an interrogating device. Because of their fundamental reliance on mass transfer, these systems are highly influenced by changes in temperature and other factors that affect the activity of molecules. Techniques have been developed to decouple such confounding variables from the signal under study, as well as devices that can simultaneously operate the sensor and actuator.[^4] [^5] 

To obtain a device capable of controlling both a sensor and actuator aimed at maintaining a desired physiological condition in plants, ie healthy plant behavior, this work aims at developing a peripheral device to monitor the environment such that the sensor and actuator can be accurately callibrated given fluctuating environmental conditions. Through this added technology, we aim to create a way for the original device[^5] to accept external, human feedback collected through sensors other than the organic bioelectronics.

### Design
To create the desired device, we begin with an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2[^6] due to its low cost, obtainment ease, prospects for long-term support, and included peripherals. To this, we add a soil moisture sensor, a light spectrum sensor to more specifically parse out photosynthetically active radiation, a water pump, a servo meant to move the arm of a plant shade, a power supply, and a small memory chip to log data.

FRITZING DIAGRAM

This device is designed to operate alone over BLE [^7] or to be accessible by an organic bioelectronics controller system, which would require perhaps only one Plant Sitter per group of plants as defined by the user.

### Validation
We test the device alone to validate its design, although open ports are made available to the organic bioelectronics controller. To do this, the device is operated by the user over BLE from an iOS-based device after its embedded system is flashed. The device will be tested by maintaining the health of a potted plant left outdoors by maintaining proper hydration levels, soil temperature, and preventing over-exposure to the intense sunlight experienced in Boulder, Colorado, USA. 

The device will be expected to log both environmental status and intervention measures given user set-points. It will also be designed to accept user exceptions, whereby a user may turn off automated controlls for a set amount of time. This would, for example, allow the user to prevent the device from watering the plant despite soil dryness for 12 hours if rainfall is expected.

Future work outside the scope of this project would be integrating this device into the main, organic bioelectronic controller enough to piggy back on its capabilities to access the internet and cloud-based softwares such that data logging and weather data could be seamlessly integrated.

Once built, this device will be left to care for seeds over a month-long investigation. The only human intervention will include filling up the water reservoir, ensuring the device is charged and undisturbed, and adjusting set-point values appropriate for the growth stage of the plant.
