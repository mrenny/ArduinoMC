## Project Charter: The Plant Sitter
### Motivation
Food security is an ever-present global challenge, growing increasingly entangled in other global challenges like climate change. This has been an ever-growing concern in The United States, particularly since the commercial introduction of fertilizer in the mid-1900s during The Green Revolution.[^1] This time period is when unsustainable processes like the over-use of fertilizers, pesticides, and monoculture practices began. As we begin to recognize the harmful effects of agricultural pollution, pesticide resilience, and the continual stripping of nutrients out of our soils, we have turned to technology to help turn the tides of sustainability in agriculture. 

Precision agriculture is an emerging field encapsulating a myriad of technologies aimed at collecting data on agricultural health in order to guide best practices.[^2] The goal is to use a variety of sensors to understand the health status and needs of an agricultrual unit, and then use emerging capabilities, like machine learning, to determine appropriate inputs. Such inputs would include resources like water, specific nutrients, or human intervention. 
	
Much of the technologies suitable to precison agriculture have parallels in human health monitoring, where the guiding principles are similar: sense, compute, adjust. It is for this reason the field of Organic Bioelectronics has begun to grow toward applications including both human and plant health monitoring. Organic bioelectronics are devices that are composed of organic, conducting polymer materials which can be fabricated at low costs. Their organic nature allows them to be tunable to fit a wide range of biocompatibility requiremetns for interfacing with living tissues. They also are ineherently better biological signal amplifiers than other organic electronics because of how the polymeric active materials interact with analytes volumetrically.[^3] 

Unlike human health monitoring where the cost of a device implant like a pace maker is high enough to justify sophisticated and costly electronics interfacing, organic bioelectronics can be fabricated for costs on the order of single dollars per sensor. With the hope that studying organic bioelectronics for use in precision agriculture will help guide further understanding of their interactions with living tissues in general, more affordable interfacing devices are required.

### Background
Organic bioelectronics consist of two major device families: electrochemical sensors and electrophoretic actuators. Both devices operate based on princples of ionic mass transfer which is transsduced into the electrical current that can be understood by an interrogating device. Because of their fundamental reliance on mass transfer, these systems are highly influenced by changes in temperature and other factors that affect the activity of molecules. Techniques have been developed to decouple such confounding variables from the signal under study, as well as devices that can simultaneously operate the sensor and actuator.[^3] 

To obtain a device capable of controlling both a sensor and actuator aimed at maintaining a desired physiological condition in plants, ie healthy plant behavior, this work aims at developing a peripheral device to monitor the environment such that the sensor and actuator can be accurately callibrated given fluctuating environmental conditions. Through this added technology, we aim to create a way for the original device[^4] to accept external, human feedback collected through sensors other than the organic bioelectronics.


### Design
To create the desired device, we begin with an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2[^5] due to its low cost, obtainment ease, prospects for long-term support, and included peripherals. To this, we add a soil moisture sensor, a light spectrum sensor to more specifically parse out photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), a water pump, a motor meant to move the plant shade, a power supply, and a small memory chip to log data.

This device is designed to operate alone over BLE [^6] [^7]or to be accessible by an organic bioelectronics controller system, which would require perhaps only one Plant Sitter per group of plants as defined by the user.

### Validation
First and foremost, the near-budget-maximum cost of this device is largely attributed to the nearly $40 microcontroller used, as well as the cost of the included peripherals. This microcontroller was chosen as it is an Arduino brand microcontroller with builtin environmental sensors and wireless communication capabilities. This allows us to design code using Arduino IDE and be the most confident that a compiled code would work as expected. 

Because use of peripherals was not a requirement of the Microcredential, we validate our overall design by successfully compiling the code in Arduino IDE 2.0.4, and demonstrating a much less sophisticated example using no external peripheral sensors or actuators.

The results of our validation testing are included in the Project Results along with the well commented code.
