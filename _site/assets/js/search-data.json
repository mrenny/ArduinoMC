Workshop Summaries Wiring &amp; Coding Inputs &amp; Outputs In this workshop, we learned about using the Arduino IDE. We learned how to control LEDs using the Blink example, but also about how to contorl the LED with a variable resistor. Important aspects of coding with Arduino IDE were addressed like specifying pin modes, what to put in the setup vs loop, etc. Controlling Speed &amp; Position with Motors In this workshop, we learned how to motors and servos worked, and some special requirements for them including the use of capacitors, the correc voltages, and diodes to ensure these parts were taken care of well. We also learned about using PWM and duty cycles to obtain \"analog\" voltages from digital ports Communication Between Arduinos, Phones &amp; More In this workshop, we learned about how microcontrollers talk to each other by serial, TX/RX, and SPI. We then learned how to attach a BLE module to an Uno so that we could send commands to the microcontroller from our phones. Finally, we learned how to speak to a secondary microcontroller over a 2.5 GHz radio signal. Miniaturization In this workshop, we learned about hte basic requirements for a microcontroller, and how much development boards include beyond just the \"brain.\" The major requirements to use a microcontroller include: a brain, a programmer, power supply/regulation, and a clock. Simple Circuits &amp; Measurement Fundamentals In this workshop we learned about the basics of measuring voltage and current using a handheld multimeter. We also learned a bit about the importance of knowing these things to ensure the current and power through components is appropriate for their ratings. Through Hole Soldering In this workshop we worked on good soldering techniques. We generally aim for a Hershey kiss shape. Soldering provides electrical contact, but also mechanical support to the component. *Screenshot of Kiosk to be added. Can't access it from remote link for some reason... Arduino Fundamentals Exam .

Problem 1.1 - Resistors a The resistor limits the current preventing rapid discharge/short circuit of the battery/voltage source. b V=IR or I=V/R c Short circuit, rapid discharge, likely rapid heating of the battery as it exothermically discharges. Sad things :C Problem 1.2 - Resistors a This circuit will have 3 voltages where hte voltage drops twice from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the battery (assumed to be ground). The current through the circuit will be less than in part 1 as we now have a higher tot al resistance. b i) N1 will be half V1. ii) N1 will be less than half V1. iii) N1 will be greater than half V1. c If you were to use the voltage at N1 as an input to another component, then yes, the relative resistances would matter as this is essentially a potentiometer/variable resistor. d See last answer, but also, if R1 and R2 were two pieces of metal with dissimilar thermoelectric properties, you could likely make a thermocouple junction by measuring the voltage at N1. Problem 2.1 - Buttons a I would suggest any of the digital pins set to pullup mode using pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP) b If you connect it to digital 8, you oculd use pinMode(8,INPUT_PULLUP); in the setup, and then have in the loop something like: bool button = digitalRead(2); Serial.println(button); delay(500); c Because we're normally pulling UP i) Lo/0/false ii)Hi/1/true Problem 2.2 - Buttons a If pin 8 is connected to the dotted line, then its Hi for both i and ii because its connected to the digital logic voltage of the Uno. b Short Circuit? [Two versions of 5V connected to ground] Problem 2.3 - Buttons a i) It should be Lo when the switch it closed, ii) and then Hi when open [because if it floats when set to pullup, it pulls up] b The resistor prevents the top voltage from touching the pullup pin. This makes it so that the pin is is always reading under the max voltage. Its pinmode makes it so that it is essentially a boolean value set to true if and only if it is touching ground voltage. c You want to chose a resistor value such that when the switch is open, the voltage is reasonably in the middle of 0 and 5V: a high enough R so that it does not think its short circuited to 5V, but also a low enough R so that it does not think there is no voltage on the other side of the resistor (although, you could probably get away a super high resistance [essentially open circuit] because the circuit will work without that connection anyway) d For this particular circuit, I could have an LED between 5V and R. When the switch is closed, The LED will go on as there is now a pathway between 5V&gt;LED&gt;R&gt;GND. When the switch is closed, pin 8 should now also read Lo and I would be able to tell when the LED is on. ",

    "content": "Motivation . Food security is an ever-present global challenge, growing increasingly entangled in other global challenges like climate change. This has been an ever-growing concern in The United States, particularly since the commercial introduction of fertilizer in the mid-1900s during The Green Revolution.1 This time period is when unsustainable processes like the over-use of fertilizers, pesticides, and monoculture practices began. As we begin to recognize the harmful effects of agricultural pollution, pesticide resilience, and the continual stripping of nutrients out of our soils, we have turned to technology to help turn the tides of sustainability in agriculture. Precision agriculture is an emerging field encapsulating a myriad of technologies aimed at collecting data on agricultural health in order to guide best practices.2 The goal is to use a variety of sensors to understand the health status and needs of an agricultrual unit, and then use emerging capabilities, like machine learning, to determine appropriate inputs. Such inputs would include resources like water, specific nutrients, or human intervention. Much of the technologies suitable to precison agriculture have parallels in human health monitoring, where the guiding principles are similar: sense, compute, adjust. It is for this reason the field of Organic Bioelectronics has begun to grow toward applications including both human and plant health monitoring. Organic bioelectronics are devices that are composed of organic, conducting polymer materials which can be fabricated at low costs. Their organic nature allows them to be tunable to fit a wide range of biocompatibility requiremetns for interfacing with living tissues. They also are ineherently better biological signal amplifiers than other organic electronics because of how the polymeric active materials interact with analytes volumetrically.3 . Unlike human health monitoring where the cost of a device implant like a pace maker is high enough to justify sophisticated and costly electronics interfacing, organic bioelectronics can be fabricated for costs on the order of single dollars per sensor. With the hope that studying organic bioelectronics for use in precision agriculture will help guide further understanding of their interactions with living tissues in general, more affordable interfacing devices are required. Background . Organic bioelectronics consist of two major device families: electrochemical sensors and electrophoretic actuators. Both devices operate based on princples of ionic mass transfer which is transsduced into the electrical current that can be understood by an interrogating device. Because of their fundamental reliance on mass transfer, these systems are highly influenced by changes in temperature and other factors that affect the activity of molecules. Techniques have been developed to decouple such confounding variables from the signal under study, as well as devices that can simultaneously operate the sensor and actuator.4 5 . To obtain a device capable of controlling both a sensor and actuator aimed at maintaining a desired physiological condition in plants, ie healthy plant behavior, this work aims at developing a peripheral device to monitor the environment such that the sensor and actuator can be accurately callibrated given fluctuating environmental conditions. Through this added technology, we aim to create a way for the original device5 to accept external, human feedback collected through sensors other than the organic bioelectronics. IMAGE OF SCHEME ALREADY EXISTING, HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY CONNECTS THE DOTS . Design . To create the desired device, we begin with an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev26 due to its low cost, obtainment ease, prospects for long-term support, and included peripherals. To this, we add a soil moisture sensor, a light spectrum sensor to more specifically parse out photosynthetically active radiation, a water pump, a servo meant to move the arm of a plant shade, a power supply, and a small memory chip to log data. FRITZING DIAGRAM . This device is designed to operate alone over BLE 7 or to be accessible by an organic bioelectronics controller system, which would require perhaps only one Plant Sitter per group of plants as defined by the user. Validation . We test the device alone to validate its design, although open ports are made available to the organic bioelectronics controller. To do this, the device is operated by the user over BLE from an iOS-based device after its embedded system is flashed. The device will be tested by maintaining the health of a potted plant left outdoors by maintaining proper hydration levels, soil temperature, and preventing over-exposure to the intense sunlight experienced in Boulder, Colorado, USA. The device will be expected to log both environmental status and intervention measures given user set-points. It will also be designed to accept user exceptions, whereby a user may turn off automated controlls for a set amount of time. This would, for example, allow the user to prevent the device from watering the plant despite soil dryness for 12 hours if rainfall is expected. Future work outside the scope of this project would be integrating this device into the main, organic bioelectronic controller enough to piggy back on its capabilities to access the internet and cloud-based softwares such that data logging and weather data could be seamlessly integrated. Once built, this device will be left to care for seeds over a month-long investigation. The only human intervention will include filling up the water reservoir, ensuring the device is charged and undisturbed, and adjusting set-point values appropriate for the growth stage of the plant.
