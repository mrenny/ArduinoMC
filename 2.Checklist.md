<summary>Workshop Summaries</summary>
<br>
<dl>
  <dt>Wiring & Coding Inputs & Outputs</dt>
  <dd>In this workshop, we learned about using the Arduino IDE. We learned how to control LEDs using the Blink example, but also about how to contorl the LED with a variable resistor. Important aspects of coding with Arduino IDE were addressed like specifying pin modes, what to put in the setup vs loop, etc.</dd>
  <dt>Controlling Speed & Position with Motors</dt>
  <dd>In this workshop, we learned how to motors and servos worked, and some special requirements for them including the use of capacitors, the correc voltages, and diodes to ensure these parts were taken care of well. We also learned about using PWM and duty cycles to obtain "analog" voltages from digital ports</dd>
  <dt>Communication Between Arduinos, Phones & More</dt>
  <dd>In this workshop, we learned about how microcontrollers talk to each other by serial, TX/RX, and SPI. We then learned how to attach a BLE module to an Uno so that we could send commands to the microcontroller from our phones. Finally, we learned how to speak to a secondary microcontroller over a 2.5 GHz radio signal.</dd>
  <dt>Miniaturization</dt>
  <dd>In this workshop, we learned about hte basic requirements for a microcontroller, and how much development boards include beyond just the "brain." The major requirements to use a microcontroller include: a brain, a programmer, power supply/regulation, and a clock.</dd>
  <dt>Simple Circuits & Measurement Fundamentals</dt>
  <dd>In this workshop we learned about the basics of measuring voltage and current using a handheld multimeter. We also learned a bit about the importance of knowing these things to ensure the current and power through components is appropriate for their ratings.</dd>
  <dt>Through Hole Soldering</dt>
  <dd>In this workshop we worked on good soldering techniques. We generally aim for a Hershey kiss shape. Soldering provides electrical contact, but also mechanical support to the component.</dd>

### Short Answer Exam
<details>
<summary>Problem 1.1 - Resistors</summary>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>a</dt>
<dd>The resistor limits the current preventing rapid discharge/short circuit of the battery/voltage source.</dd>
<dt>b</dt>
<dd>V=IR or I=V/R</dd>
<dt>c</dt>
<dd>Short circuit, rapid discharge, likely rapid heating of the battery as it exothermically discharges. Sad things :C</dd>
</dl>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Problem 1.2 - Resistors</summary>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>a</dt>
<dd>This circuit will have 3 voltages where hte voltage drops twice from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the battery (assumed to be ground). The current through the circuit will be less than in part 1 as we now have a higher tot al resistance.</dd>
<dt>b</dt>
<dd> i) N1 will be half V1. ii) N1 will be less than half V1. iii) N1 will be greater than half V1.
</dd>
<dt>c</dt>
<dd>If you were to use the voltage at N1 as an input to another component, then yes, the relative resistances would matter as this is essentially a potentiometer/variable resistor.</dd>
<dt>d</dt>
<dd>See last answer, but also, if R1 and R2 were two pieces of metal with dissimilar thermoelectric properties, you could likely make a thermocouple junction by measuring the voltage at N1.</dd>
</dl>

<summary>Problem 2.1 - Buttons</summary>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>a</dt>
<dd>I would suggest any of the digital pins set to pullup mode using pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP)</dd>
<dt>b</dt>
<dd>If you connect it to digital 8, you oculd use pinMode(8,INPUT_PULLUP); in the setup, and then have in the loop something like: bool button = digitalRead(2); Serial.println(button); delay(500);</dd>
<dt>c</dt>
<dd>Because we're normally pulling UP i) Lo/0/false ii)Hi/1/true</dd>
</dl>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Problem 2.2 - Buttons</summary>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>a</dt>
<dd>If pin 8 is connected to the dotted line, then its Hi for both i and ii because its connected to the digital logic voltage of the Uno.</dd>
<dt>b</dt>
<dd> Short Circuit? [Two versions of 5V connected to ground]
</dd>
</dl>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Problem 2.3 - Buttons</summary>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>a</dt>
<dd>i) It should be Lo when the switch it closed, ii) and then Hi when open [because if it floats when set to pullup, it pulls up]</dd>
<dt>b</dt>
<dd> The resistor prevents the top voltage from touching the pullup pin. This makes it so that the pin is is always reading under the max voltage. Its pinmode makes it so that it is essentially a boolean value set to true if and only if it is touching ground voltage. </dd>
<dt>c</dt>
<dd>You want to chose a resistor value such that when the switch is open, the voltage is reasonably in the middle of 0 and 5V: a high enough R so that it does not think its short circuited to 5V, but also a low enough R so that it does not think there is no voltage on the other side of the resistor (although, you could probably get away a super high resistance [essentially open circuit] because the circuit will work without that connection anyway)</dd>
<dt>d</dt>
<dd>For this particular circuit, I could have an LED between 5V and R. When the switch is closed, The LED will go on as there is now a pathway between 5V>LED>R>GND. When the switch is closed, pin 8 should now also read Lo and I would be able to tell when the LED is on.</dd>
